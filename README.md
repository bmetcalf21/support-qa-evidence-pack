# Support Ops Portfolio

Sanitized, simulated work samples for Tier-1 Technical Support and Support Operations roles.
No real client or production data is included.

## Current Scope
- Focus areas: account access (SSO, MFA) with adjacent troubleshooting patterns.
- Positioning: support/QA execution quality with clear triage, escalation, and documentation.
- Platform exposure today: Jira Service Management (`screenshots/jsm-ticket-01-mfa-loop.jpeg`).
- Platform learning in progress: ServiceNow and Freshdesk (`badges/README.md`).

## Current Repository Contents
- Tickets (simulated): `tickets/`
- Screenshots (tool exposure evidence): `screenshots/`
- Reusable templates: `templates/`
- Evidence index: `evidence-index.md`
- Badge and cert tracker: `badges/`
