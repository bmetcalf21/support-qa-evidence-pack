# Support Ops Portfolio

Sanitized, simulated work samples for Tier-1 Technical Support and Support Operations roles.
No real client or production data is included.

## Current Scope
- Focus areas: account access (SSO, MFA) with adjacent troubleshooting patterns.
- Positioning: support/QA execution quality with clear triage, escalation, and documentation.
- Platform exposure today: Jira Service Management (`screenshots/jsm-ticket-01-mfa-loop.jpeg`).
- Platform learning in progress: ServiceNow and Freshdesk (`badges/README.md`).
- Additional workflow simulation coverage: Zendesk-style and Freshdesk-style tickets.

## Current Repository Contents
- Tickets (simulated): `tickets/`
- Knowledge base articles (simulated): `knowledge-base/`
- QA artifacts (simulated): `qa-artifacts/`
- Runbooks (simulated): `runbooks/`
- Screenshots (tool exposure evidence): `screenshots/`
- Reusable templates: `templates/`
- Evidence index: `evidence-index.md`
- Badge and cert tracker: `badges/`

## Quick Review (60 Seconds)
1. Open `tickets/ticket-01-mfa-loop.md`.
2. Open `screenshots/jsm-ticket-01-mfa-loop.jpeg`.
3. Open `qa-artifacts/test-plan.md`.
4. Open `evidence-index.md` for full cross-links (KBs, bugs, and runbook).

## Planned Build-Out (In Progress)
- ServiceNow and Freshdesk badge artifacts as they are completed.
