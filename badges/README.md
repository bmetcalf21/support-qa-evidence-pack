# Badges and Certifications (In Progress)

This folder stores proof artifacts for platform learning (screenshot or PDF exports).

Truth-safe rule: a platform is marked complete only after a proof file exists in this folder and is linked from `evidence-index.md`.

## Current Plan

| Platform | Goal | Proof File Pattern | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ServiceNow | Complete an entry-level badge/cert | `badges/servicenow-YYYY-MM-DD.*` | In Progress |
| Freshdesk | Complete an entry-level badge/cert | `badges/freshdesk-YYYY-MM-DD.*` | In Progress |

## Notes

- All artifacts in this folder are from training and certification programs, not production environments.
- Keep all artifacts sanitized and free of personal data.
