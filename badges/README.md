# Badge and Certification Artifacts

This folder stores proof files for earned platform credentials (screenshot or PDF export).

Truth-safe rule: a credential is shown publicly only after its proof file exists in this folder and is linked from `evidence-index.md`.

## File Naming Convention

- ServiceNow credentials: `badges/servicenow-<credential>-YYYY-MM-DD.(png|pdf)`

## Notes

- Add artifacts only after completion; do not include planned or placeholder files.
- All artifacts in this folder should be sanitized and free of personal data.
